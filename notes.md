## Type Specifications
Type specifications **typespecs** are annotations that you add to source files.
They are kind of half way between comments and code: have no effect on runtime, but like code
they are syntax checked by the compiler, cause additional metadata to be emitted to the complier output.

Typespecs are used to document elixir functions.
The spec line mirrors the function definition. It includes the function name, the type of each parameter, and the type of the return value.
```elixir
@spec titlecase(String.t) :: String.t
def titlecase(title) do
  # ...
end
```

This is a test of what is to come
